This repository contains code and resources related to **ByteZip**, a deep learning-based approach for efficient lossless compression of structured byte streams. ByteZip leverages advanced machine learning models, including autoencoders and mixture density networks, to achieve high compression ratios while preserving data integrity. This work was presented at the **2024 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)**.
